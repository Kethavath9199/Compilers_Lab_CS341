    "The file(text) is first split on the basis of spaces, curly braces, parentheses and comments of both variety. abstract, final, static are all defined before class therfore the assumption that after class you will have the class name is true. inheritance must always have the \"extends\" keyword, therefore we count that. comments are a bit tricky, since nested comments don't exist\n",
    "// /* will be treated as a single line comment. /* // will be treated as a multiline comment.  An active comment activates a comment flag, which then ignores the count of anything.  A comment with a \"class\" keyword won't count that.  Same with a comment within a comment and other keywords within the comment.  Constructors are counted by the same class name iff the curly brace count is positive.  Note that if the curly brace count ever becomes negative we can expect wrong results.  I.e. suppose you put a \"}\" and then write the code normally, curly brace count will be negative so we cant recognize classes.  A modification would be to reset the curly_brace count to be zero each time we go into a class, however, that would violate the condition of keeping track of every curly brace.  This superdependence on curly braces isn't a problem, since it is expected that curly braces hold, or we just throw an error.  "
